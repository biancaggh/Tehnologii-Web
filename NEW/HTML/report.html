            Terrorism Web Visualizer is a tool for flexible visualization of data on global terrorism. The statistics and visualizations generated are represented in 3 ways: chart, map and table, each one of them having information about the gravity, year, numbers
            for different regions. The data provided can be saved in different formats: CSV, WebP and SVG.

        </h2>
        <p>
            In our overview of terrorism, we try to understand how the number of terrorist acts varies around the world and how it has changed over time. To do this, we need a clear and consistent definition of what terrorism is and how it is different from any other
            form of violence.
            <cite><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism">[1]</a></cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            Terrorism is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as <q>the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.</q> We quickly see that this definition is unspecific and subjective. The issue
            of subjectivity in this case means that there is no internationally recognised legal definition of terrorism. Despite considerable discussion, the formation of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism by the United Nations
            has always been impeded by the lack of consensus on a definition.
            <cite><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism">[1]</a></cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            The key problem is that terrorism is difficult to distinguish from other forms of political violence and violent crime, such as state-based armed conflict, non-state conflict, one-sided violence, hate crime, and homicide. The lines between these different
            forms of violence are often blurry.
            <cite><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism">[1]</a></cite>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, we take a look at standard criteria of what constitutes terrorism, collect the data on this subject and display it in different formats. This way a web tool for flexible visualization of data on global terrorism is created, with different ways to
            display data and to export the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following sections are presented the requirements of the application, the features, teh way our users interact with it and the responsabilities of each member of the team.

        <p>
            Create a Web tool for flexible visualization of global terrorism data based on its own REST / GraphQL API. The statistics and visualizations generated - minimum 3 modes + cartographic renderings, by regions, decades and gravity, using profile Web services
            - can be exported in CSV, WebP and SVG formats. The system will also provide support for multi-criteria search for reported incidents, including additional details on weapons used - external data sources will be used.
